🏋️‍♀️📊 **My Fitness Journey Through Data** 

Welcome to My Fitness Journey Through Data! This repository is a data-driven exploration of my health and fitness journey using real-world data collected from my Apple Watch. Through data analysis and visualisation, I aim to uncover insights into my activity patterns, exercise habits, and overall wellbeing.

🚀 **Project Overview**

As I transition into my new career in data, I decided to turn the lens on myself - analysing my own health and fitness data using my new skills to uncover insights about my own journey. I’ve written a article that tells my fitness story through real data (link below). So, if you grew up hating PE, always felt like the ‘unfit’ one, or struggled with consistency when life gets busy, I hope this inspires you to realise that you’ve made more progress than you think - just keep going! This was such a fun way to apply python to personal data and I look forward to doing it again in the future.

🤝 **Contributing**

This is a personal project, but I’d love to hear feedback and suggestions! Feel free to reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn.
